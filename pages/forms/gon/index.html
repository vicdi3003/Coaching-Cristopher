      <div class="text">
        <p>Hunter x Hunter sassortment of characters is undoubtedly one of the series strongest points. Most fans appreciate the characters and their wild dynamics more than any other aspect concerning the series. The characters are, after all, the common denominator between all the essential attributes that build up the Hunter x Hunter that fans love and care for.</p>
        <p>Gon Freecs, the series is lead character, is one of the most controversial lead characters in shonen history. Love him or hate him, there is just too many things going on around Gon. He is innocent yet apathetic, happy-go-lucky yet very vengeful. His complexity is head and shoulders above most shonen leads. What is even more striking is how he disguises his complexity for simplicity.</p>

            <h3>curiosities</h3>
            <ul class="list">
              <li><p>Yes, Gon is not that innocent--or maybe he is. While it is true that he initially sells himself for your average energetic shonen protagonist, that does not continue for long. As the series progresses, fans learn that Gon is morals are as vague as morals can be.</p></li>
              <li><p>Gon is indeed one of the most complex characters in Hunter x Hunter. It is just that his complexity takes time to fragment. His transition is more on the vague side, but once it is noticed, it can not be unnoticed.</p></li>
              <li><p>One of the more interesting aspects of Gon is his initial kick-off. He was introduced completely blank in and out. No strong narrative was built to advance his character, as such, all opinions concerning him are based on semi-subjective standpoints.</p></li>
              <li><p>Unlike most shonen protagonists who start-off with a hacks ability or two, Gon did not receive such privilege. Although his talent and potential for growth are more than impressive, that does not grant him an edge on the first part of the story.</p></li>
